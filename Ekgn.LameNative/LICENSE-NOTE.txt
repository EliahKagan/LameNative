LICENSE.txt in this NuGet package is a copy of LICENSE in the top-level
directory of the LAME source tree. The "COPYING" file that it refers to ("see
COPYING in this folder") is the LGPL v2, provided as COPYING-LGPL-2.0.txt in
this NuGet package. However, a handful of files in the LAME source code are
licensed under the LGPL v2.1 or later, rather than the LGPL v2 or later. So, to
be safe, I'm including both licenses and distributing this NuGet package under
the terms of the LGPL v2.1 or later.

The README.md file in the Git repository for this NuGet package has more
details.
