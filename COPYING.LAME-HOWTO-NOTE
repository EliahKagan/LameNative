COPYING.LAME-HOWTO is a copy of lame-3.100/LICENSE. The file it refers to as
"COPYING in this folder" is thus lame-3.100/COPYING, which is the LGPL v2. In
contrast, COPYING in this top-level repository directory is the LGPL v2.1. See
README.md for an explanation of why two versions of the LGPL are included.
